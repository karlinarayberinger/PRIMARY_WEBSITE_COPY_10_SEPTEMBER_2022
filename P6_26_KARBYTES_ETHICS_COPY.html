<p><span style="background:#00ffff;">“My website is a part of my mind. My mind is a part of my website. Both are meant to survive, evolve, and expand forever.” – karbytes</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that the <strong style="background:#000000;color:#00ffff;">turquoise</strong> highlighted quote on this web page uses the word <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mind</a> to refer to the (either finite or else infinitely large) allocation of <strong>pure nothingness</strong> (i.e. <strong>pure consciousness</strong>) which encompasses all of the memories and experiences which the author of this website (i.e. Karlina Ray Beringer (i.e. <strong>karbytes</strong>)) has ever been the renderer of. The previous sentence is meant to be interpreted within the context of a pansychic worldview (i.e. an assumption that the whole of nature is contained within exactly one ubiquitous mind).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following paragraphs describe the goals of the author of the website whose Uniform Resource Locator is phonetically worded as <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a>.</span></p>
<p>Note that the term <strong>ethics</strong> refers to the conceptualization and the implementation of goal-oriented behaviors.</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to preserve knowledge which its one and only author (i.e. Karlina Ray Beringer) wants to remember.</p>
<p>One of the goals which the author of this website has is to extend the lifetime of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> which is the author of this website for as long of a time period as possible and, also, to extend the existence of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intellectual property</a> which comprises this website (and websites which this website links to and which the author of this website also authored) for as long of a time period as possible.</p>
<p>One hypothesis which the author of this website has is that it is possible for the intellectual property which comprises this website to be transcribed from one substrate to another substrate in a verbatim retrievable format such the same information processing agent can access that same transcribed intellectual property <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinitely</a> many times (which would imply that the information processing agent which is observing each one of those transcriptions experiences a continuity of consciousness which is infinitely long). In other words, such an attention span would be immortal yet still experience the passage of <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a>.</p>
