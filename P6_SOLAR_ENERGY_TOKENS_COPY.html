<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions (and elaborating paragraphs) describe a system of money whose notion of economic value is directly proportional to the number of watts of electricity produced by solar cells (and each one of those Solar Energy Tokens expires 12 “months” after being created). The name of the type of system described in this web page is <strong>Solar Energy Tokens Economy</strong>. A particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy may exist on a single satellite, an entire planet, or some other structure which exists inside of a finite allocation of <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">space-time</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that, in economies in which the demand (per “month”) for physical commodities is significantly lower than is the rate at which such physical commodities are procured, money may not be necessary. The purpose of money is to ration commodities such that as many people as possible are able to purchase such commodities such that no person is favored over any other in terms of who gets access to such commodities.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>N:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of persons which lives inside of a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy (and a <strong>person</strong> is a “arbitrarily intelligent” <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> (and each person which lives inside of a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy owns exactly one uniquely corresponding Solar Energy Tokens Bank Account)).</p>
<p>Note that the term <strong>“arbitrarily intelligent”</strong> in the context of this web page refers to a class of intelligence which is considered to be similar to humans according to most humans if humans are the most dominant species within an ecosystem which can be transformed into a Solar Energy Tokens Economy whose constituent Solar Energy Tokens Bank Account owners are each an individual member of that most dominant species. <span style="background:#00ff00;">(The author of this website expects all human individuals to either die or else transform into cyborgs by replacing each of their organic body parts with prosthetics and/or new organic body parts which are cloned from the human individual’s own <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stem cells</a>).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>E:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watts</a> of electricity (and a <strong>watt</strong> is a joule of energy being transferred from one finite region of space to some other finite region of space across one second) which are generated from each one of the photovoltaic cells which sustain exactly one Solar Energy Tokens Economy during a particular “month” (and one <strong>“month”</strong> is exactly 30 days (and each <strong>day</strong> is exactly 24 hours (and each <strong>hour</strong> is exactly 60 minutes (and each <strong>minute</strong> is exactly 60 <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seconds</a>)))).</p>
<p>Note that a Solar Energy Tokens Economy implements <strong>sustainable energy production</strong> which is the process of converting naturally-occurring inputs into usable electricity in a manner which produces almost zero pollution and almost zero environmental hazards and in a manner which can be replicated for indefinitely long periods of time. Photovoltaic cells an especially versatile means for sustainably producing energy.</p>
<p>A <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photovoltaic cell</a> is a “solid state” device (i.e. has no moving parts) which passively converts incoming photons from starlight into outgoing electrons by absorbing those photons into some kind of material which releases electrons when the electrons inside of that material become too energetic to stay in orbit around their respective atoms. Those freed electrons then flow out of the photovoltaic cell across wires as usable electricity.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that the energy of an electrical current (e.g. photovoltaic cell output) can be stored as potential energy inside of a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flywheel</a> which winds the entire length of a cable around a spool using an electricity-powered motor. Then the spool is locked in a fixed position such that it cannot unwind. When the energy stored in a wound up flywheel cable is needed by the encompassing Solar Energy Tokens Economy, a switch unlocks the flywheel such that the spool can unwind in a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(device)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spring</a>-loaded fashion and cause turbines studded in magnets to rotate <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnets</a> past a relatively stationary conducting medium such that an electrical current is generated and electrons subsequently flow out of the system across wires as usable electricity.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>S:</strong> a fixed <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural number</a> of watts of electricity which are used to produce exactly one Solar Energy Token (and a <strong>Solar Energy Token</strong> is a unit of abstract economic exchange (i.e. money) within a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy (and each Solar Energy Token is represented by exactly one unique and finite sequence of <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/binary_to_decimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">binary digits</a> across a network of digital computers)).</p>
<p>A unit of <strong>money</strong> is exactly one of some natural number of abstract homogeneously-typed objects which are used to symbolically represent a specific desired commodity.</p>
<p>A <strong>commodity</strong> is some kind of physical resource whose availability is finite and which persons want to utilize. <span style="background:#00ff00;">(A person can use money to reserve some commodity for that person’s exclusive use if that person pays to use that commodity before some other person pays to use that same commodity).</span></p>
<p>Within the context of the economies described in this web page, each Solar Energy Token Bank Account owner may trade some natural number of Solar Energy Tokens for a particular desired product or service whose price is equivalent to that natural number of Solar Energy Tokens.</p>
<p>Within the context of the economies describes in this web page, each Solar Energy Token Bank Account owner may donate Solar Energy Tokens to some other Solar Energy Token Bank Account owner. (To <strong>donate</strong> is to provide a commodity (and money may be considered to be a “meta commodity” (which is still technically a commodity)) to a recipient without requiring the recipient to provide a commodity in return to the provider. In simpler terms, donating a commodity to a person is the same thing as giving that commodity to a person unconditionally except for the condition of the recipient requesting the donation).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">In order to prevent the subjective value of each Solar Energy Token from depreciating (i.e. starting from a positive value and then approaching zero) within a Solar Energy Tokens Economy as the total number of Solar Energy Tokens within that economy approaches <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinity</a>, each Solar Energy Token expires 12 “months” after that particular Solar Energy Token was generated. Once a particular Solar Energy Token expires, the unique binary digits sequence associated with that Solar Energy Token may be recycled as the unique identifier for some new Solar Energy Token.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>T:</strong> a nonnegative integer number of Solar Energy Tokens which were yielded from the E watts of electricity which were generated during a particular “month” within a particular Solar Energy Token Economy (and T is the rounded down nonnegative integer which is produced by dividing E by S).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>W:</strong> a natural number of Solar Energy Tokens to deposit into each one of the N Solar Energy Token Bank Accounts within a particular Solar Energy Tokens Economy at some arbitrary transition point between two “months” (and W is the rounded down nonnegative integer which is produced by dividing T by N).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">W is the <strong>universal basic income</strong> amount of Solar Energy Tokens which each Solar Energy Tokens Bank Account receives from the government at the end of the “month” in which those Solar Energy Tokens were produced.</span></p>
<p>The dependent variable W may fluctuate across different months if either one of the independent variables N or E fluctuate across different months.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>E will increase if (a0) the average solar cell efficiency increases within the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy while (b0) the total number of solar cells does not decrease sufficiently enough to cancel out the increase in solar cell efficiency within the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy and while (c0) the intensity of the stellar light source powering those solar cells does not decrease sufficiently to cancel out the increase in solar cell efficiency.</p>
<p>E will increase if (a1) the total number of solar cells increases within the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy while (b1) the average solar cell efficiency does not decrease sufficiently enough to cancel out the increase in solar cell count and while (c1) the intensity of the stellar light source powering those solar cells does not decrease sufficiently to cancel out the increase in solar cell count.</p>
<p>E will increase if (a2) the intensity of the stellar light source powering the solar cells of a Solar Energy Tokens Economy increases while (b2) the average solar cell efficiency does not decrease sufficiently enough to cancel out the increase in the intensity of the stellar light source and while (c2) the average solar cell efficiency does not decrease sufficiently enough to cancel out the increase in the intensity of the stellar light source.</p>

<p>E will decrease if (a3) the average solar cell efficiency decreases within the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy while (b3) the total number of solar cells does not increase sufficiently enough to cancel out the decrease in solar cell efficiency within the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy and while (c3) the intensity of the stellar light source powering those solar cells does not increase sufficiently to cancel out the decrease in solar cell efficiency.</p>
<p>E will decrease if (a4) the total number of solar cells decreases within the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy while (b4) the average solar cell efficiency does not increase sufficiently enough to cancel out the decrease in solar cell count and while (c4) the intensity of the stellar light source powering those solar cells does not increase sufficiently to cancel out the decrease in solar cell count.</p>
<p>E will decrease if (a5) the intensity of the stellar light source powering the solar cells of a Solar Energy Tokens Economy decreases while (b5) the average solar cell efficiency does not increase sufficiently enough to cancel out the decrease in the intensity of the stellar light source and while (c5) the average solar cell efficiency does not increase sufficiently enough to cancel out the decrease in the intensity of the stellar light source.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>N will increase if the number of persons who are deemed to be citizens of the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy increases while the number of citizens within that Solar Energy Tokens Economy who relinquish their citizenship does not increase sufficiently enough to cancel out the increase in citizen count within the respective colony (and a person’s citizenship is <strong>relinquished</strong> either by that person leaving the colony to live elsewhere or else by that person dying).</p>
<p>N will decrease if the number of citizens who relinquish their citizenship within the respective colony increases while the number of number of persons who are deemed to be citizens of the respective Solar Energy Tokens Economy does not increase sufficiently enough to cancel out the decrease in that colony’s citizen count.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">Note that, if a person dies or else leaves a Solar Energy Tokens Economy, that person’s Solar Energy Token Bank Account will be deleted after each one of the Solar Energy Tokens in that Solar Energy Token Bank Account are transferred to the government’s central reserve ((i.e. <strong>Solar Energy Tokens Central Reserve</strong>) where new Solar Energy Tokens are stored before being distributed to each one of the N Solar Energy Token Bank Accounts). Those transferred Solar Energy Tokens will be added to the T value of the upcoming “monthly” universal basic income distribution. Hence, the W value for that upcoming “monthly” universal basic income distribution will increase by some nonnegative integer number of Solar Energy Tokens as a consequence of that person’s Solar Energy Token Bank Account being drained and then deleted.</span></p>
